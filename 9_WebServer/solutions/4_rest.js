// Exercise 5: REST.
////////////////////

// REST (Representational Transfer State) is a widely used pattern
// to create API which is implemented by Express.

// It contains four methods to do CRUD operations: 

// - POST:     Create a new resource, 
// - GET:      Read an existing resource,
// - PUT:      Update an existing resource,
// - DELETE:   Delete an exiting resource.

// More details here: 
// https://restfulapi.net/
// https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-rest-api/

// In practice this semantic representation is seldom implemented in full,
// and only GET and POST requests are used. 

// The main difference between GET and POST is that POST submits additional
// information as a payload to body of the HTTP request, while GET as a query
// string. For this, POST is preferred when larger pieces of information are 
// transferred or when dealing with sensitive data. 

// More details here:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Need these instructions for cloud.
// const cors = require('cors');
// app.use(cors());

// File in directory /public/ will be cached and served.
const path = require('path');
// If running from solutions' directory.
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public')));
// If running from exercises' directory.
// app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// POST (and PUT) requests require additional middleware to parse
// the HTTP requests' body.
app.use(express.json()); 
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Third-party. Load the cookie-parsing middleware.
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
app.use(cookieParser())

// Intercepts all requests.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Yay! The server is running!');
});

// Intercepts requests through the path /secret.
app.get('/secret', (req, res) => {
  res.send('How did you know about this route? It was a secret!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000.
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server listening on port: ${PORT}`));

// Exercise 4: REST.
////////////////////

// a. Create a new route "/activities" that uses the function
// getActivities() defined below. This function asynchronously returns
// all the activities used in the Bootstrap chapter. 

// Solution.
app.get("/activities/", async (req, res) => {
	const activities = await getActivities();
	res.send(activities)
});

// b. Copy index.html and rename to fetch.html. Update it to to fetch
// the activities using the REST API that you just created here.
// Hint: use the fetch command.


// c. Express can assign route segments to variables. This is
// useful to create more readable and compact urls, avoiding the use of
// query string. For instance, these two routes are equivalent:

// /activities/?id=1
// /activities/1

// To parse "1" as an id in the second route in the example above, 
// create the route using the colon operator followed by a variable name:

// "/activities/:id" 

// The id variable will theh be available in the res object under

// res.params.id

// Here is your task. 
// 
// - Create a route that takes one id as parameter, and returns just one
// activity, the id of which is its position in the array of activities
// as returned by getActivities().
// 
// - Copy file fetch.html and rename to fetch_one.html and fetch
// a _random_ activity.

// Hint: generate a random integer between 0 and 11 (tot num of activities):
// https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_random.asp  


app.get("/activities/:id", async (req, res) => {
	const activities = await getActivities();
	res.send(activities[req.params.id]);
});

// d. Optional. 
// You want to protect your precious list of activities with a super secret
// access key (equal to "123").
//
// You know by now that GET requests are not well-suited for sensitive data
// and you decided to reimplement a., b. using POST routes. 
//
// Finally, copy file fetch.html and rename to fetch_post.html and fetch
// the activities with a POST request instead of a GET request. 

// Hint1: On Express, you can simply specify a route as app.post(...). 
// Hint2: On the browser, the fetch implements GET requests by default. You
// can modify this behavior with additional configuration object:

// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch

// Hint3: Do not forget to call JSON.stringify on your payload.

// We could use a middleware, but it would apply also to GET requests. So
// we create this "poor-man" middleware and use it as a function inside
// the route's callback.
let checkAuth = (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.key !== "123") {
      res.status(500);
      res.send("You are not authorized");
      return false;  
  };
  return true;
}

app.post("/activities/", async (req, res) => {
  if (!checkAuth(req, res)) return;
	const activities = await getActivities();
	res.send(activities);
});
