// Exercise 5: Publish your web server on the cloud.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// You have created a beautiful web server!

// a. It is time to share it with the world. On the cloud.

// There is a plethora of options available, but just a few
// are free. Amongst these, Heroku is quite popular:

// https://www.heroku.com/

// 1. Create a free account on Heroku.

// 2. Create a new folder outside of the exercises folder
// (must not be a git repo).

// 3. Copy file 4_rest.js and rename to app.js (you can pick any name).

// 4. On Heroku, you can no longer set the port for your server,
// Heroku will decide it for you at runtime. So, you need to modify
// the PORT declaration with this line:

// const PORT = 3000;

// to:

// const PORT = process.env.PORT || 80;

// 5. Create a Procfile that will tell Heroku how to launch your app:
// https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile
//
// TL;DR, a Procfile is a file named Procfile (without extentions) containing:
// web: node app.js

// 6. Copy package.json inside the folder: it will tell Heroku which
// dependencies to install (e.g., express).

// 7. Create a public/ folder and add fetch_post.html, 8_bootstrap_forms.html,
// the css and js folders, and the favicon.ico file.
// Rename fetch_post.html to index.html.

// 8. Head over to:

// https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#tracking-your-app-in-git

// and follow the instructions to deploy your server to Heroku.
//
// Pay attention at the name of your branch (master vs main),
// command "git branch" will show you the name of your branch.

// b. You will get assigned a unique URL for your web site, such as
// thawing-inlet-61413.herokuapp.com.

// Update the js files of the heroku app to fetch the list of activities
// from this address.

// c. Locally: copy the file fetch_post.html to fetch_post_heroku.html,
// and fetch the list of activities from the remote server on Heroku.

// You will be soon struck by a CORS error. What are CORS?
// Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP header that allows
// a server to communicate with clients from other origins.

// Ref:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

// By default CORS are disabled. How to enable them? Luckily, there is now
// the CORS module.

// Ref: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors

// However it is not enough... You also need to accept incoming requests
// containing JSON in their body. The lines below will save you:

// Module cors need to be installed.
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
    "Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,content-type,application/json"
  );
  next();
});

// c. Optional. Do you want to be really cool? Create a new folder, only with
// fetch_post.html and related files. Push it to Heroku, and let the two heroku
// apps communicate with each other.
